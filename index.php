	 * [Page template]	Index: Blog lister
	 *
	 * This is a core WordPress template file and is required by all themes. It's 
	 * the most basic template that will be used if no other template files exist. 
	 * Typically though it'll be used as the template for the "Blog" lister page.
	 *
	 * You should note the `wp_header()` and `wp_footer();` hooks that plugins and 
	 * WordPress core may use to add additional HTML and stylesheets and/or 
	 * JavaScript files to the website.
	 *
	 * Please note: You should enqueue stylesheets and JavaScript documents
	 * - DO NOT simply insert them in this document.
