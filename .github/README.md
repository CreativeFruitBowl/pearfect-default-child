## Summary

This child theme is to be used in conjuction with the Pearfect Framework parent theme. This specific child theme is for The Very Creative Fruit Bowl Company corporate website.

This repo should always be using the latest (stable) version of WordPress.

## Usage

The interesting parts of this website are the theme and the bespoke plugin for additional functionality.

### Theme

The theme uses Gulp to compile SCSS (with source maps), run it through [AutoPrefixr](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer), lint, concatenate and minify JavaScript (with source maps), optimise images and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) the browser (with an extension), with flexibility to add any additional tasks via the Gulpfile.

Alternatively, you could use Codekit or PrePros to compile the SCSS and JavaScript (without source maps).

## Credits

Without these projects, this WordPress Starter Theme wouldn't be where it is today.
